    "In this lesson we will discuss basic Pandas operation. Pandas is a very powerful library for doing data science. It's has its issues but I've found that in a normal situation with some shouting at Pandas, you're still about 10 times faster if you use it. So let's dive in! We'll do some basic feature extraction and data selection today.\n",

    "To demonstrate this statistics crash course, we'll use the [Coronavirus](https://www.kaggle.com/brendaso/2019-coronavirus-dataset-01212020-01262020) dataset. It describes the spread of *2019-nCov* throughout the world on a per day basis.\n",
